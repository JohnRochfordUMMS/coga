			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This document is to help us gather techniques and strategies as we come across them, so that they do not get forgotten or are hard to find later when we are finished the gap analysis.</p>
			<p>Larger scale, engineering solutions can also be added to the issue papers.</p>
			<p><strong>Document structure:</strong> The top level headings are who the techniques and strategies are for, such as general techniques that help most people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities, techniques that help for attention, techniques that help people with difficulty processing language etc. The sections are based on function and not disability names. </p>
			<p>The document is the divided into topics (such as E<em>mphasis Structure</em>) at heading level 3, and then into individual techniques at heading level 4. Each topic also has a "see also" section where you can put WCAG mappings. Where appropriate the techniques can labeled for localization. </p>
			<p>Each technique is divided into: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Explanation and who it helps,</li>
				
			  <li> Pass examples, (if needed) </li>
				<li>Failure examples,(if needed) and </li>
				<li>Sources/research. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Tags are for who it helps ("use for" tags) and for who can detriment ("avoid for" tags) from use of this strategy. The default is that a strategy is good for all groups.</p>
			<p>Tags can be for the cognitive function impairments or other user descriptors such as localization.</p>
			<p> For example </p>
			<p><strong>"Use for:</strong> Short Term Memory" would imply that this strategy is helpful for people with a short term memory impairment.</p>
			<p>Tags can be concatenated. For example: "Short Term Memory-Visual Memory". Additional terms are limiting, and the tag becomes more specific as we concatenate terms.</p>
			<p>Tags for cognitive function are found in the Cognitive Function Table (link to be provided soon).</p>
			<p> Localization tags so far include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-semitic languages and semitic languages (note these tags need more expansion for Chinese etc)</li>
				<li>Low context and high context cultures</li>
				<li>Familiarity with the Internet and web 2.0. Note this is often age related. Tags are: <ul>
						<li>Experienced Internet User: Uses Web 2.0 extensively, will use avatars and familiarizer with social media conventions.</li>
						<li> Intermediate Internet User: Knows how to use basic pages without thinking.</li>
						<li>Basic Internet user: Has learned about links and buttons.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Feel free to put in a technique even if you do not have all this information. However try to provide any research that you know of - even if it is just your own personal experience. If you add a localization category, please also add it to this introduction.</p>

			<h2>General techniques </h2>
			<p>General techniques are useful for most people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Use a clear structure </h3>
				<section>
					<h4>Break your content into manageable chunks</h4>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Have one subject per page. </li>
						<li>Have one idea per paragraph. (One sentence is enough for a paragraph) </li>
						<li>A sentence should never have more than one idea. </li>
						<li>Identify 1-3 main tasks that covers most of what users want to do. Make sure it is obvious how to do them as soon as the content loads. </li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
						<p> This brakes the content into tasks that the user can cope with. </p>
					</section>

					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Use headings and labels describe topic or purpose.</h4>
					<p>Simple colored headings with fonts two size larger than general content to aid navigation skills</p>
					<section>
						<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
						<p>This supports those who have reading and some visual perceptual difficulties due to Receptive Aphasia (Wernicke’s Aphasia) and acquired dyslexia as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities, where long sentences and complex words can cause difficulties. [EDN1</p>

					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Use consistent styles</h4>
					<p>Ensure:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>appearance of controls and menu items consistent in all areas</li>
						<li>clarity of display on plain backgrounds</li>
						<li>fonts are of a single style</li>
						<li>icons, controls and menus are used consistently across your site.</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h5>Explanation and who it helps: </h5>
						<p>This supports those who have reading and some visual perceptual difficulties due to Receptive Aphasia and acquired dyslexia as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities. It also helps those with visual acuity difficulties where stroke and age related disabilities co-occur. </p>
					</section>
					 
				  <section>
						<h4>Tags</h4>
						<p><strong> Use for tags: </strong>All<br /> Receptive Aphasia, acquired dyslexia, visual acuity difficulties<br />
							<strong>Avoid for tags: </strong></p>

					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Use presentation, color and symbols to convey structure, and relationships</h4>
					<p>Ensure that </p>
					<ul>
						<li>icons, controls and menus are located in consistent and non- distracting areas.</li>
						<li>highlight key points in bold - (be careful not to over use, because it feels like shouting)</li>
						<li>text boxes to highlight important information</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
						<p>“People with aphasia post-stroke have also been reported to have more specific design preferences compared to people without aphasia, preferring written stroke information to contain color and text supported with diagrams” (Eames et al., 2003)ii </p>

				<section>
					<h4>Use lists</h4>
					<p>Ensure that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>bullet points are well spaced</li>
						<li>a minimal number of words are used (e.g.5)</li>
						<li>Lists are not cluttered by surrounding items</li>
						<li>Keywords start the statement such as “Stroke happens suddenly”i</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>

				<section>
					<h4>Use presentation to show structure</h4>
					<p>Include a short introduction to summarize content </p>
					<ul>
						<li>divide the information into topics</li>
						<li>keep main information easy to find, e.g. to the top left where the eye goes first in English (consider localization for right to left languages such as Arabic)</li>
						<li>use white space and lines to define areas </li>
						<li>include an index</li>
						<li>keep linking images simple and explanatory</li>
						<li>use visual grouping to enable filtering of content without overwhelming</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
						<p>This supports people with intellectual disabilities those who have any type of Aphasia, specific learning difficulties as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities. This supports those who have Dementia and/or acquire cognitive disabilities as they Age. </p>

					<h3>Use symbols and images to show meaning</h3>
					<p>Explanation and who it helps:</p>
					<p>Symbols as an addition to short sentences and phrases can understanding. </p>
					<p>However as some people have difficulty remembering symbols, use text with the symbol.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use clear symbols that can easily be seen and expanded</li>
						<li>Use images understood by different users</li>
						<li>In left to right languages place the image to the left of the text</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In the future we intend to enable semantics that will add symbols that are easy to use by the individual user.</p>

							<li> Info and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. (WCAG 1.3.1 Level A) </li>
							<li> Headings and Labels: Headings and labels describe topic or purpose. (WCAG 2.4.6 Level AA) </li>
							<li>Consistent Navigation: Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user. (WCAG 3.2.3 Level AA) </li>
							<li>Consistent Identification: Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently. (WCAG 3.2.4 Level AA)</li>

					<h3>Use clear visual affordances.</h3>
					<p>Actions and actionable items that can be interacted with should have a clear visual style to indicate this eg buttons should look like buttons. Use techniques like 'flat design' with great care as they have much reduced affordances.</p>
					<h4>Explanation and who it helps:</h4>
					<p>All but especially those with some forms of autism</p>

					<h3>Be predictable</h3>
					<p>The more predictable your content is the easier it is to know how to use it. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use a consistent layout for all your content</li>
						<li>Use the same icons and buttons to serve the same function</li>
						<li>Use the same linked text to go to the same page </li>
						<li>Use standard layout design, so it is easy to find common content. In 2015 in English sites this includes: <ul>
								<li>the search box is in the right hand corner</li>
								<li>a link to home page in the left hand corner</li>
								<li>site map in the footer, etc.</li>

				<ul>
					<li>the message is clear</li>
					<li>extraneous information is separated (preferably removed)</li>
					<li>one message is delivered at a time</li>
					<li>key points are separated out</li>

					<li>use common words that are easily understood by your audience</li>
					<li>avoid hyphenated words and acronyms (unless they are easily understandable)</li>
					<li>be factual</li>
					<li>use clear headings to signpost information</li>
					<li>lists and bullet points are used</li>
					<li>order of statements is logical </li>
					<li> use words that make it clear what will happen when links and buttons are used (such as &quot;search&quot; in place of &quot;submit&quot;)</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Use active rather than passive voice.</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure that the subject starts the sentence </li>
					<li>Possible use of ‘you’ but careful use of other pronouns such as ‘she’, ‘he’ etc ii</li>
					<li>Determiners such as ‘this’ and ‘that’ can confuse</li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
					<p>Those with Expressive Aphasia may ?nd the use of passive voice “di?cult due to problems with retrieving the relevant grammatical morphemes” and those with receptive Aphasia may also find it hard to automatically understand the meaning of passive voice . This supports those who have Dementia and/or acquire cognitive disabilities as they Age. </p>

				<h4>Avoid double negatives.</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>It is important to avoid sentences that contain double negatives or dependent clauses for example <em>“</em><em>He doesn’t have nothing but the clothes on his back.”</em></li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
					<p>These sentences tend to be grammatically incorrect and confusing – their use should be avoided for those who have intellectual disabilities, any type of Aphasia, specific learning difficulties as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities. This supports those who have Dementia and/or acquire cognitive disabilities as they Age.</p>

				<h4>Checking Readability </h4>
				<p>Check long documents in sections to determine which parts are too hard to read. Flesch Reading Ease score: Rates text on a 100-point scale. The higher the score, the easier it is to understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 70 to 80. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score: Rates text on a U.S. grade-school level. For example, a score of 5.0 means that a fifth grader, i.e., a Year 6, average 10 years old, can understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 5.0 by using short sentences, not by simplifying vocabulary.</p>

				<h3>Provide rapid and direct feedback.</h3>
				<p>Applications should continuously provide easily-recognizable feedback of success or failure with every action.</p>
				<p>Applications should also let the user know what just happened and where they are in a process. For example &quot;your email was sent&quot;. </p>
				<p>Spoken feedback is often more effective then written feedback.</p>

			<h3>Help meaning</h3>
			<section>
				<h4>Include short tooltips on all icons, jargon</h4>
				<p>These may not be noticed by some who have severe aphasia and a visual agnosia and could add clutter and even confuse if they are read out by a screen reader or text to speech support. But for those with less severe difficulties they could be helpful. If tooltips are to be used they must precise and relate directly to the object.</p>
				<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
				<p>The amount of help offered by tooltips very much depends on the ability of the user as do many of the techniques above. </p>
				<p> These is helpful to most persons with intellectual disabilities. Sometimes a person with an intellectual disability can get confused and distracted. If tooltips are to be used they must precise and relate directly to the object.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Guideline 3.1 Readable: Make text content readable and understandable.</li>
						<li>Unusual Words: A mechanism is available for identifying specific definitions of words or phrases used in an unusual or restricted way, including idioms and jargon. (3.1.3 Level AAA)</li>
						<li>Abbreviations: A mechanism for identifying the expanded form or meaning of abbreviations is available. (3.1.4 Level AAA)</li>
						<li>Reading Level: When text requires reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level after removal of proper names and titles, supplemental content, or a version that does not require reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level, is available. (3.1.5Level AAA)</li>
						<li>Pronunciation: A mechanism is available for identifying specific pronunciation of words where meaning of the words, in context, is ambiguous without knowing the pronunciation. (3.1.6 Level AAA) </li>

				<h4>Use of charts and graphics</h4>
				<p> Where appropriate, create charts and graphics to provide additional ways to reinforce important concepts</p>
				<p>However, graphics should be clear and easy to identify what is going on</p>
				<p> The ability to “read between the lines” of a text, graphic, or lecture may seem like an exercise in “common sense,” but it may create barriers for students with autism, who may not be able to readily discern the intended relevance of graphical data.</p>
				<p> Clear explanations may reduce undue cognitive loads for all users.</p><section>

              <h4 >Use of synchronized highlighting, of complex graphics and formula with speech</h4>
              <p> Associate maths, sections of math and sections of complex items with explanations. </p>
              <p>Provide text or speech explanations for sections of   charts, mathematical formula and graphics, so that the section of the   formula or graphic being discussed can be highlighted at the same time   as the explanatory text is being read. </p>
              <p>For example, when the text is describing the denominator of a formula, that denominator should be highlighted. </p>
              <p>Note that this requires an accessible format for math such as MathML used with  aria-describedby and CSS.</p>
              <p>This has been shown to increase math comprehension by 10%

					<li>font size is between 14 and 18 pt</li>
					<li>there is no change in font style</li>
					<li>Avoid narrow columns (as used in newspapers)</li>
					<li>capital letters are used sparingly e.g. first word only and names</li>
					<li>Take care to use bold text just for key items, avoid using <em>italics</em>, ALLCAPS or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underline</span> for emphasis </li>
					<li>Text and images should be expandable.</li>
					<li>Avoid text and numbers in images, including equations</li>
					<li>Make important information two font sizes bigger </li>
					<li>Try to avoid the underlining of text - where hyperlinks may have the default underline ensure they have a different color </li>
					<li>Lines should not be too long: 60 to70 characters. </li>
					<li>Avoid cramping material and using long, dense paragraphs: space it out. with one idea per paragraph. </li>
					<li> Line spacing of 1.5 is preferable. </li>
					<li>Use bullet points and numbering rather than continuous prose.</li>
					<li>Avoid using non standard font alternatives such as Cufo'n </li>
				</ul>

            <p>Explanation and who it helps:</p>
            <p>This avoids confusion with the start of the working week and allows for fewer booking errors.  It helps those who have dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and those who may be under high cognitive load or situationally disabled. </p>
            <p>Examples</p>
            <p>Currently many web based calendars require settings to be changed to suit the locale.  Users may not be aware of the start of the week in the locale e.g. Sunday in the Middle East and be unable to take appropriate actions to suit their needs.</p>

			<h2>Techniques under development</h2><section>
			  <h3>Enable adaptability</h3>
				<p>Use rich semantic tags to show what things are so that they can be adapted for the user.</p>
				<p>This can be done in HTML</p>
				<p>Example: </p>
                <p>&lt;h2&gt; contact us&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
                <p>You can also use   the aria attribute of aria-function. This allows the user agent to add symbols and extra help.</p>
                <p>Example: &lt;button type="button" aria-function=&quot;undo&quot; &gt;default&lt;/button&gt;</p>
                <p>Use the   landmarks and aria ePub or coga roles, whenever they are appropriate.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>&lt;section role=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;</p>

                <p>aria-feedback= "your email was sent" </p>
                <p>aria-explain= "this item costs more"</p>
                <p><span>&lt;span aria-numberfree=&quot;almost all&quot;&gt;9 out of 10</span> &lt;/span&gt; </p>
                <p>Using standard HTML tags is also useful, such as </p>
                <p>&lt;h2&gt; contact us&lt;/h2&gt; </p>
